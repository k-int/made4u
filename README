To include the CaclulationServerClientsPlugin plugin, the easiest method is to edit your grails-app/config/BuildConfig.groovy file and add

grails.plugin.location.'CalculationServerClientsPlugin'='../CalculationServerClientsPlugin'

This allows the build to automatically reference any target artefacts from the plugin, and removes the need to do relative builds on each small change.


The plugin is built using

grails package-plugin

and can be released using

grails release-plugin
